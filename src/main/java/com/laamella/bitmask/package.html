<h1>Bitmask collision detection library</h1>

<p>This library will give 2D graphics developers, especially game
developers, a tool to quickly detect whether two images overlap by
comparing their actual visible pixels. This is done by creating an extra
datastructure for every image, the Bitmask. It contains the pattern of
visible pixels of the image as a pattern of bits. Overlaps can be found
very quickly by simply AND-ing two of these bitmasks, supplying an
offset.</p>

<p>This library was originally written by Ulf Ekstr√∂m. The Java port
is by Danny van Bruggen. It is ported from the code found in <a
	href="http://www.pygame.org/news.html">Pygame</a></p>

<p>Technical background: <a
	href="http://imrtechnology.ngemu.com/downloads/tutorial.pdf">A 2d
collision detection tutorial, including a C implementation.</a></p>

<p>Note that for now, only one collision detection method has been
ported, but this happens to be the most essential one.</p>
